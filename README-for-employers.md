# Vending-Machine - First Tech Elevator Capstone

This is the first capstone project in Tech Elevator's bootcamp. I redid the capstone by myself during my time as an academic fellow.

This application utilizes Java Object Oriented Principles while using File I/O to create software for a vending machine.
